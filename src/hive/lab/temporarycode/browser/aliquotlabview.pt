        <h4>Instructions, Description of Buttons</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Save All Changes:</strong>
            Saves any entered data for both checked and unchecked aliquot in the
            current batch to the database. Look for confirmation at the top of
            the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create Labels for Selected:</strong>
            A label for the selected aliquot will be created and listed below in
            the "Labels Ready to Print" section. NOTE: this does not save
            changes, or reflect any unsaved changes in the label. Be sure to
            save your changes before creating your labels
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check-in Selected:</strong>
            Saves changes to both checked and unchecked aliquot, as above. Then
            moves the selected aliquot to its checked-in state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mark Selected Unused:</strong>
            Marks the selected aliquot as unused. This generally means you
            generated an aliquot in the database, and then did not have the
            specimen to actually create it. NOTE: No changes are saved when you
            press this button.
          </li>

        <h2>Label Printing</h2>
        <p>The Aliquot Label form, which shows below when there are labels to
          print, keeps track of the labels made for the aliquot created above.
          To print, simply leave the check boxes checked, and press "Print
          Selected". Be sure to use the refresh list button after you print!</p>

        <h4>Instructions, Description of Buttons</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Print Selected:</strong>
            This will print all of the selected labels. After the labels are
            printed, they are removed from the list, so make sure to press the
            "Refresh List" button after you print!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refresh List:</strong>
            Refreshes the list of labels, to only show unprinted labels. This
            will be automatic in a future release.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remove Selected:</strong>
            Remove the selected label from the list. Use this button when you
            don't want to print a label for an aliquot you have already created.
            NOTE: this does not affect the created aliquot, only the label.
