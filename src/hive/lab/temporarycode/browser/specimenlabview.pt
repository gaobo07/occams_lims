        <h2>Aliquot Templates</h2>
        <p>The Aliquot Template table shows the potential types of aliquot you
          can get from the specimen selected above. You can use this form to
          create aliquot from the same specimen multiple times.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Aliquot and Label Selected:</strong>
            Will create a number of aliquot (as entered in the "Aliquot Count"
            field) from the selected specimen with the data entered. You can do
            this process multiple times. If you do not know a value, you can
            modify the aliquot on the next screen. After the aliquot is created,
            its label will be listed below in the "Labels Ready to Print"
            section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete Selected Specimen:</strong>
            When you have fully aliquoted a specimen, you can mark it as
            complete by checking the box next *any* of its aliquot templates and
            pressing this button.
            <br />
            Note that at this time, if you complete any part of a specimen, the
            entire specimen will be marked as complete.

        <h2>Label Printing</h2>
        <p>The Aliquot Label form, which shows below when there are labels to
          print, keeps track of the labels made for the aliquot created above.
          To print, simply leave the check boxes checked, and press "Print
          Selected". Be sure to use the refresh list button after you print!</p>

          <li>
            <strong>Remove Selected:</strong>
