Known Issues
============

6/27/11 (mmartinez) zmi_view error on instance start

    On a fresh install, lovely.session will error on instance restart with the
    following message: 
   
        ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'menu', \
        "ImportError: Couldn't import zmi_views, No module named zmi_views")
        
    This is caused by `hive.lab` attempting to load a dependency ZCML files.
    Initial investigation suggests that the ZCML files for lovely.session
    are not needed and so  the ``<includeDependencies>`` tag can be
    safely removed. Although this requires further testing before a fix
    is implemented. 
    
    
6/27/11 (mmartinez) Fresh install generic setup profiles missing

    The current build of this project assumes that the project is being
    migrated from an already existing `avrc.aeh` installation and so it
    offers no facilities for a fresh installation, which hinders test
    environment development.
